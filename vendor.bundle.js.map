If this information is new, please navigate to the\n * {\\@link Component#animations component animations metadata page} to gain a better\n * understanding of how animations in Angular are used.\n *\n * `trigger` Creates an animation trigger which will a list of {\\@link state state} and\n * {\\@link transition transition} entries that will be evaluated when the expression\n * bound to the trigger changes.\n *\n * Triggers are registered within the component annotation data under the\n * {\\@link Component#animations animations section}. An animation trigger can be placed on an element\n * within a template by referencing the name of the trigger followed by the expression value that\n * the\n * trigger is bound to (in the form of `[\\@triggerName]=\"expression\"`.\n *\n * Animation trigger bindings strigify values and then match the previous and current values against\n * any linked transitions. If a boolean value is provided into the trigger binding then it will both\n * be represented as `1` or `true` and `0` or `false` for a true and false boolean values\n * respectively.\n *\n * ### Usage\n *\n * `trigger` will create an animation trigger reference based on the provided `name` value. The\n * provided `animation` value is expected to be an array consisting of {\\@link state state} and\n * {\\@link transition transition} declarations.\n *\n * ```typescript\n * \\@Component({\n *   selector: 'my-component',\n *   templateUrl: 'my-component-tpl.html',\n *   animations: [\n *     trigger(\"myAnimationTrigger\", [\n *       state(...),\n *       state(...),\n *       transition(...),\n *       transition(...)\n *     ])\n *   ]\n * })\n * class MyComponent {\n *   myStatusExp = \"something\";\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * The template associated with this component will make use of the `myAnimationTrigger` animation\n * trigger by binding to an element within its template code.\n *\n * ```html\n * <!-- somewhere inside of my-component-tpl.html -->\n * <div [\\@myAnimationTrigger]=\"myStatusExp\">...</div>\n * ```\n *\n * ## Disable Animations\n * A special animation control binding called `\\@.disabled` can be placed on an element which will\n * then disable animations for any inner animation triggers situated within the element as well as\n * any animations on the element itself.\n *\n * When true, the `\\@.disabled` binding will prevent all animations from rendering. The example\n * below shows how to use this feature:\n *\n * ```ts\n * \\@Component({\n *   selector: 'my-component',\n *   template: `\n *     <div [\\@.disabled]=\"isDisabled\">\n *       <div [\\@childAnimation]=\"exp\"></div>\n *     </div>\n *   `,\n *   animations: [\n *     trigger(\"childAnimation\", [\n *       // ...\n *     ])\n *   ]\n * })\n * class MyComponent {\n *   isDisabled = true;\n *   exp = '...';\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * The `\\@childAnimation` trigger will not animate because `\\@.disabled` prevents it from happening\n * (when true).\n *\n * Note that `\\@.disbled` will only disable all animations (this means any animations running on\n * the same element will also be disabled).\n *\n * ### Disabling Animations Application-wide\n * When an area of the template is set to have animations disabled, **all** inner components will\n * also have their animations disabled as well. This means that all animations for an angular\n * application can be disabled by placing a host binding set on `\\@.disabled` on the topmost Angular\n * component.\n *\n * ```ts\n * import {Component, HostBinding} from '\\@angular/core';\n *\n * \\@Component({\n *   selector: 'app-component',\n *   templateUrl: 'app.component.html',\n * })\n * class AppComponent {\n *   \\@HostBinding('\\@.disabled')\n *   public animationsDisabled = true;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * ### What about animations that us `query()` and `animateChild()`?\n * Despite inner animations being disabled, a parent animation can {\\@link query query} for inner\n * elements located in disabled areas of the template and still animate them as it sees fit. This is\n * also the case for when a sub animation is queried by a parent and then later animated using {\\@link\n * animateChild animateChild}.\n *\n * \\@experimental Animation support is experimental.\n * @param {?} name\n * @param {?} definitions\n * @return {?}\n */\nfunction trigger$1(name, definitions) {\n    return { type: 7 /* Trigger */, name: name, definitions: definitions, options: {} };\n}\n/**\n * `animate` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular's\n * animation DSL language. If this information is new, please navigate to the {\\@link\n * Component#animations component animations metadata page} to gain a better understanding of\n * how animations in Angular are used.\n *\n * `animate` specifies an animation step that will apply the provided `styles` data for a given\n * amount of time based on the provided `timing` expression value. Calls to `animate` are expected\n * to be used within {\\@link sequence an animation sequence}, {\\@link group group}, or {\\@link\n * transition transition}.\n *\n * ### Usage\n *\n * The `animate` function accepts two input parameters: `timing` and `styles`:\n *\n * - `timing` is a string based value that can be a combination of a duration with optional delay\n * and easing values. The format for the expression breaks down to `duration delay easing`\n * (therefore a value such as `1s 100ms ease-out` will be parse itself into `duration=1000,\n * delay=100, easing=ease-out`. If a numeric value is provided then that will be used as the\n * `duration` value in millisecond form.\n * - `styles` is the style input data which can either be a call to {\\@link style style} or {\\@link\n * keyframes keyframes}. If left empty then the styles from the destination state will be collected\n * and used (this is useful when describing an animation step that will complete an animation by\n * {\\@link transition#the-final-animate-call animating to the final state}).\n *\n * ```typescript\n * // various functions for specifying timing data\n * animate(500, style(...))\n * animate(\"1s\", style(...))\n * animate(\"100ms 0.5s\", style(...))\n * animate(\"5s ease\", style(...))\n * animate(\"5s 10ms cubic-bezier(.17,.67,.88,.1)\", style(...))\n *\n * // either style() of keyframes() can be used\n * animate(500, style({ background: \"red\" }))\n * animate(500, keyframes([\n *   style({ background: \"blue\" })),\n *   style({ background: \"red\" }))\n * ])\n * ```\n *\n * {\\@example core/animation/ts/dsl/animation_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * \\@experimental Animation support is experimental.\n * @param {?} timings\n * @param {?=} styles\n * @return {?}\n */\nfunction animate$1(timings, styles) {\n    if (styles === void 0) { styles = null; }\n    return { type: 4 /* Animate */, styles: styles, timings: timings };\n}\n/**\n * `group` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular's\n * animation DSL language.

Instead of applying animations from where they are currently to their\n * destination, keyframes can describe how each style entry is applied and at what point within the\n * animation arc (much like CSS Keyframe Animations do).\n *\n * For each `style()` entry an `offset` value can be set. Doing so allows to specifiy at what\n * percentage of the animate time the styles will be applied.\n *\n * ```typescript\n * // the provided offset values describe when each backgroundColor value is applied.\n * animate(\"5s\", keyframes([\n *   style({ backgroundColor: \"red\", offset: 0 }),\n *   style({ backgroundColor: \"blue\", offset: 0.2 }),\n *   style({ backgroundColor: \"orange\", offset: 0.3 }),\n *   style({ backgroundColor: \"black\", offset: 1 })\n * ]))\n * ```\n *\n * Alternatively, if there are no `offset` values used within the style entries then the offsets\n * will be calculated automatically.\n *\n * ```typescript\n * animate(\"5s\", keyframes([\n *   style({ backgroundColor: \"red\" }) // offset = 0\n *   style({ backgroundColor: \"blue\" }) // offset = 0.33\n *   style({ backgroundColor: \"orange\" }) // offset = 0.66\n *   style({ backgroundColor: \"black\" }) // offset = 1\n * ]))\n * ```\n *\n * {\\@example core/animation/ts/dsl/animation_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * \\@experimental Animation support is experimental.\n * @param {?} steps\n * @return {?}\n */\nfunction keyframes$1(steps) {\n    return { type: 5 /* Keyframes */, steps: steps };\n}\n/**\n * `transition` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular's\n * animation DSL language. If this information is new, please navigate to the {\\@link\n * Component#animations component animations metadata page} to gain a better understanding of\n * how animations in Angular are used.\n *\n * `transition` declares the {\\@link sequence sequence of animation steps} that will be run when the\n * provided `stateChangeExpr` value is satisfied. The `stateChangeExpr` consists of a `state1 =>\n * state2` which consists of two known states (use an asterix (`*`) to refer to a dynamic starting\n * and/or ending state).\n *\n * A function can also be provided as the `stateChangeExpr` argument for a transition and this\n * function will be executed each time a state change occurs. If the value returned within the\n * function is true then the associated animation will be run.\n *\n * Animation transitions are placed within an {\\@link trigger animation trigger}. For an transition\n * to animate to a state value and persist its styles then one or more {\\@link state animation\n * states} is expected to be defined.\n *\n * ### Usage\n *\n * An animation transition is kicked off the `stateChangeExpr` predicate evaluates to true based on\n * what the previous state is and what the current state has become. In other words, if a transition\n * is defined that matches the old/current state criteria then the associated animation will be\n * triggered.\n *\n * ```typescript\n * // all transition/state changes are defined within an animation trigger\n * trigger(\"myAnimationTrigger\", [\n *   // if a state is defined then its styles will be persisted when the\n *   // animation has fully completed itself\n *   state(\"on\", style({ background: \"green\" })),\n *   state(\"off\", style({ background: \"grey\" })),\n *\n *   // a transition animation that will be kicked off when the state value\n *   // bound to \"myAnimationTrigger\" changes from \"on\" to \"off\"\n *   transition(\"on => off\", animate(500)),\n *\n *   // it is also possible to do run the same animation for both directions\n *   transition(\"on <=> off\", animate(500)),\n *\n *   // or to define multiple states pairs separated by commas\n *   transition(\"on => off, off => void\", animate(500)),\n *\n *   // this is a catch-all state change for when an element is inserted into\n *   // the page and the destination state is unknown\n *   transition(\"void => *\", [\n *     style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *     animate(500)\n *   ]),\n *\n *   // this will capture a state change between any states\n *   transition(\"* => *\", animate(\"1s 0s\")),\n *\n *   // you can also go full out and include a function\n *   transition((fromState, toState) => {\n *     // when `true` then it will allow the animation below to be invoked\n *     return fromState == \"off\" && toState == \"on\";\n *   }, animate(\"1s 0s\"))\n * ])\n * ```\n *\n * The template associated with this component will make use of the `myAnimationTrigger` animation\n * trigger by binding to an element within its template code.\n *\n * ```html\n * <!-- somewhere inside of my-component-tpl.html -->\n * <div [\\@myAnimationTrigger]=\"myStatusExp\">...</div>\n * ```\n *\n * #### The final `animate` call\n *\n * If the final step within the transition steps is a call to `animate()` that **only** uses a\n * timing value with **no style data** then it will be automatically used as the final animation arc\n * for the element to animate itself to the final state. This involves an automatic mix of\n * adding/removing CSS styles so that the element will be in the exact state it should be for the\n * applied state to be presented correctly.\n *\n * ```\n * // start off by hiding the element, but make sure that it animates properly to whatever state\n * // is currently active for \"myAnimationTrigger\"\n * transition(\"void => *\", [\n *   style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *   animate(500)\n * ])\n * ```\n *\n * ### Transition Aliases (`:enter` and `:leave`)\n *\n * Given that enter (insertion) and leave (removal) animations are so common, the `transition`\n * function accepts both `:enter` and `:leave` values which are aliases for the `void => *` and `*\n * => void` state changes.\n *\n * ```\n * transition(\":enter\", [\n *   style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *   animate(500, style({ opacity: 1 }))\n * ])\n * transition(\":leave\", [\n *   animate(500, style({ opacity: 0 }))\n * ])\n * ```\n *\n * ### Boolean values\n * if a trigger binding value is a boolean value then it can be matched using a transition\n * expression that compares `true` and `false` or `1` and `0`.\n *\n * ```\n * // in the template\n * <div [\\@openClose]=\"open ? true : false\">...</div>\n *\n * // in the component metadata\n * trigger('openClose', [\n *   state('true', style({ height: '*' })),\n *   state('false', style({ height: '0px' })),\n *   transition('false <=> true', animate(500))\n * ])\n * ```\n * {\\@example core/animation/ts/dsl/animation_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * \\@experimental Animation support is experimental.\n * @param {?} stateChangeExpr\n * @param {?} steps\n * @param {?=} options\n * @return {?}\n */\nfunction transition$1(stateChangeExpr, steps, options) {\n    if (options === void 0) { options = null; }\n    return { type: 1 /* Transition */, expr: stateChangeExpr, animation: steps, options: options };\n}\n/**\n * `animation` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular's\n * animation DSL language.\n *\n * `var myAnimation = animation(...)` is designed to produce a reusable animation that can be later\n * invoked in another animation or sequence.

It works by allowing a queried element to execute its own\n * animation within the animation sequence.\n *\n * Each time an animation is triggered in angular, the parent animation\n * will always get priority and any child animations will be blocked. In order\n * for a child animation to run, the parent animation must query each of the elements\n * containing child animations and then allow the animations to run using `animateChild`.\n *\n * The example HTML code below shows both parent and child elements that have animation\n * triggers that will execute at the same time.\n *\n * ```html\n * <!-- parent-child.component.html -->\n * <button (click)=\"exp =! exp\">Toggle</button>\n * <hr>\n *\n * <div [\\@parentAnimation]=\"exp\">\n *   <header>Hello</header>\n *   <div [\\@childAnimation]=\"exp\">\n *       one\n *   </div>\n *   <div [\\@childAnimation]=\"exp\">\n *       two\n *   </div>\n *   <div [\\@childAnimation]=\"exp\">\n *       three\n *   </div>\n * </div>\n * ```\n *\n * Now when the `exp` value changes to true, only the `parentAnimation` animation will animate\n * because it has priority. However, using `query` and `animateChild` each of the inner animations\n * can also fire:\n *\n * ```ts\n * // parent-child.component.ts\n * import {trigger, transition, animate, style, query, animateChild} from '\\@angular/animations';\n * \\@Component({\n *   selector: 'parent-child-component',\n *   animations: [\n *     trigger('parentAnimation', [\n *       transition('false => true', [\n *         query('header', [\n *           style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *           animate(500, style({ opacity: 1 }))\n *         ]),\n *         query('\\@childAnimation', [\n *           animateChild()\n *         ])\n *       ])\n *     ]),\n *     trigger('childAnimation', [\n *       transition('false => true', [\n *         style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *         animate(500, style({ opacity: 1 }))\n *       ])\n *     ])\n *   ]\n * })\n * class ParentChildCmp {\n *   exp: boolean = false;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * In the animation code above, when the `parentAnimation` transition kicks off it first queries to\n * find the header element and fades it in. It then finds each of the sub elements that contain the\n * `\\@childAnimation` trigger and then allows for their animations to fire.\n *\n * This example can be further extended by using stagger:\n *\n * ```ts\n * query('\\@childAnimation', stagger(100, [\n *   animateChild()\n * ]))\n * ```\n *\n * Now each of the sub animations start off with respect to the `100ms` staggering step.\n *\n * ## The first frame of child animations\n * When sub animations are executed using `animateChild` the animation engine will always apply the\n * first frame of every sub animation immediately at the start of the animation sequence. This way\n * the parent animation does not need to set any initial styling data on the sub elements before the\n * sub animations kick off.\n *\n * In the example above the first frame of the `childAnimation`'s `false => true` transition\n * consists of a style of `opacity: 0`. This is applied immediately when the `parentAnimation`\n * animation transition sequence starts. Only then when the `\\@childAnimation` is queried and called\n * with `animateChild` will it then animate to its destination of `opacity: 1`.\n *\n * Note that this feature designed to be used alongside {\\@link query query()} and it will only work\n * with animations that are assigned using the Angular animation DSL (this means that CSS keyframes\n * and transitions are not handled by this API).\n *\n * \\@experimental Animation support is experimental.\n * @param {?=} options\n * @return {?}\n */\n/**\n * `useAnimation` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular's\n * animation DSL language.

The context\n * for each instantiated template inherits from the outer context with the given loop variable\n * set to the current item from the iterable.\n *\n * ### Local Variables\n *\n * `NgForOf` provides several exported values that can be aliased to local variables:\n *\n * - `$implicit: T`: The value of the individual items in the iterable (`ngForOf`).\n * - `ngForOf: NgIterable<T>`: The value of the iterable expression. Useful when the expression is\n * more complex then a property access, for example when using the async pipe (`userStreams |\n * async`).\n * - `index: number`: The index of the current item in the iterable.\n * - `first: boolean`: True when the item is the first item in the iterable.\n * - `last: boolean`: True when the item is the last item in the iterable.\n * - `even: boolean`: True when the item has an even index in the iterable.\n * - `odd: boolean`: True when the item has an odd index in the iterable.\n *\n * ```\n * <li *ngFor=\"let user of userObservable | async as users; index as i; first as isFirst\">\n *    {{i}}/{{users.length}}. {{user}} <span *ngIf=\"isFirst\">default</span>\n * </li>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Change Propagation\n *\n * When the contents of the iterator changes, `NgForOf` makes the corresponding changes to the DOM:\n *\n * * When an item is added, a new instance of the template is added to the DOM.\n * * When an item is removed, its template instance is removed from the DOM.\n * * When items are reordered, their respective templates are reordered in the DOM.\n * * Otherwise, the DOM element for that item will remain the same.\n *\n * Angular uses object identity to track insertions and deletions within the iterator and reproduce\n * those changes in the DOM. This has important implications for animations and any stateful\n * controls (such as `<input>` elements which accept user input) that are present. Inserted rows can\n * be animated in, deleted rows can be animated out, and unchanged rows retain any unsaved state\n * such as user input.\n *\n * It is possible for the identities of elements in the iterator to change while the data does not.\n * This can happen, for example, if the iterator produced from an RPC to the server, and that\n * RPC is re-run.

Typically the:\n *  - `then` template is the inline template of `ngIf` unless bound to a different value.\n *  - `else` template is blank unless it is bound.\n *\n * ## Most common usage\n *\n * The most common usage of the `ngIf` directive is to conditionally show the inline template as\n * seen in this example:\n * {\\@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfSimple'}\n *\n * ## Showing an alternative template using `else`\n *\n * If it is necessary to display a template when the `expression` is falsy use the `else` template\n * binding as shown. Note that the `else` binding points to a `<ng-template>` labeled `#elseBlock`.\n * The template can be defined anywhere in the component view but is typically placed right after\n * `ngIf` for readability.\n *\n * {\\@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfElse'}\n *\n * ## Using non-inlined `then` template\n *\n * Usually the `then` template is the inlined template of the `ngIf`, but it can be changed using\n * a binding (just like `else`). Because `then` and `else` are bindings, the template references can\n * change at runtime as shown in this example.\n *\n * {\\@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfThenElse'}\n *\n * ## Storing conditional result in a variable\n *\n * A common pattern is that we need to show a set of properties from the same object. If the\n * object is undefined, then we have to use the safe-traversal-operator `?.` to guard against\n * dereferencing a `null` value. This is especially the case when waiting on async data such as\n * when using the `async` pipe as shown in following example:\n *\n * ```\n * Hello {{ (userStream|async)?.last }}, {{ (userStream|async)?.first }}!\n * ```\n *\n * There are several inefficiencies in the above example:\n *  - We create multiple subscriptions on `userStream`. One for each `async` pipe, or two in the\n *    example above.\n *  - We cannot display an alternative screen while waiting for the data to arrive asynchronously.\n *  - We have to use the safe-traversal-operator `?.` to access properties, which is cumbersome.\n *  - We have to place the `async` pipe in parenthesis.\n *\n * A better way to do this is to use `ngIf` and store the result of the condition in a local\n * variable as shown in the the example below:\n *\n * {\\@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfAs'}\n *\n * Notice that:\n *  - We use only one `async` pipe and hence only one subscription gets created.\n *  - `ngIf` stores the result of the `userStream|async` in the local variable `user`.\n *  - The local `user` can then be bound repeatedly in a more efficient way.\n *  - No need to use the safe-traversal-operator `?.` to access properties as `ngIf` will only\n *    display the data if `userStream` returns a value.\n *  - We can display an alternative template while waiting for the data.\n *\n * ### Syntax\n *\n * Simple form:\n * - `<div *ngIf=\"condition\">...</div>`\n * - `<div template=\"ngIf condition\">...</div>`\n * - `<ng-template [ngIf]=\"condition\"><div>...</div></ng-template>`\n *\n * Form with an else block:\n * ```\n * <div *ngIf=\"condition; else elseBlock\">...</div>\n * <ng-template #elseBlock>...</ng-template>\n * ```\n *\n * Form with a `then` and `else` block:\n * ```\n * <div *ngIf=\"condition; then thenBlock else elseBlock\"></div>\n * <ng-template #thenBlock>...</ng-template>\n * <ng-template #elseBlock>...</ng-template>\n * ```\n *\n * Form with storing the value locally:\n * ```\n * <div *ngIf=\"condition as value; else elseBlock\">{{value}}</div>\n * <ng-template #elseBlock>...</ng-template>\n * ```\n *\n * \\@stable\n */\nvar NgIf = (function () {\n    /**\n     * @param {?} _viewContainer\n     * @param {?} templateRef\n     */\n    function NgIf(_viewContainer, templateRef) {\n        this._viewContainer = _viewContainer;\n        this._context = new NgIfContext();\n        this._thenTemplateRef = null;\n        this._elseTemplateRef = null;\n        this._thenViewRef = null;\n        this._elseViewRef = null;\n        this._thenTemplateRef = templateRef;\n    }\n    Object.defineProperty(NgIf.prototype, \"ngIf\", {\n        /**\n         * @param {?} condition\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        set: function (condition) {\n            this._context.$implicit = this._context.ngIf = condition;\n            this._updateView();\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    Object.defineProperty(NgIf.prototype, \"ngIfThen\", {\n        /**\n         * @param {?} templateRef\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        set: function (templateRef) {\n            this._thenTemplateRef = templateRef;\n            this._thenViewRef = null; // clear previous view if any.\n            this._updateView();\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    Object.defineProperty(NgIf.prototype, \"ngIfElse\", {\n        /**\n         * @param {?} templateRef\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        set: function (templateRef) {\n            this._elseTemplateRef = templateRef;\n            this._elseViewRef = null; // clear previous view if any.\n            this._updateView();\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    /**\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    NgIf.prototype._updateView = function () {\n        if (this._context.$implicit) {\n            if (!this._thenViewRef) {\n                this._viewContainer.clear();\n                this._elseViewRef = null;\n                if (this._thenTemplateRef) {\n                    this._thenViewRef =\n                        this._viewContainer.createEmbeddedView(this._thenTemplateRef, this._context);\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        else {\n            if (!this._elseViewRef) {\n                this._viewContainer.clear();\n                this._thenViewRef = null;\n                if (this._elseTemplateRef) {\n                    this._elseViewRef =\n                        this._viewContainer.createEmbeddedView(this._elseTemplateRef, this._context);\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    };\n    return NgIf;\n}());\nNgIf.decorators = [\n    { type: Directive, args: [{ selector: '[ngIf]' },] },\n];\n/**\n * @nocollapse\n */\nNgIf.ctorParameters = function () { return [\n    { type: ViewContainerRef, },\n    { type: TemplateRef, },\n]; };\nNgIf.propDecorators = {\n    'ngIf': [{ type: Input },],\n    'ngIfThen': [{ type: Input },],\n    'ngIfElse': [{ type: Input },],\n};\n/**\n * \\@stable\n */\nvar NgIfContext = (function () {\n    function NgIfContext() {\n        this.$implicit = null;\n        this.ngIf = null;\n    }\n    return NgIfContext;\n}());\n/**\n * @license\n * Copyright Google Inc.

It\n     * might be for example a function that you passed to a {@link create} static factory, but most of the time it is\n     * a library implementation, which defines what and when will be emitted by an Observable. This means that calling\n     * `subscribe` is actually the moment when Observable starts its work, not when it is created, as it is often\n     * thought.\n     *\n     * Apart from starting the execution of an Observable, this method allows you to listen for values\n     * that an Observable emits, as well as for when it completes or errors. You can achieve this in two\n     * following ways.\n     *\n     * The first way is creating an object that implements {@link Observer} interface. It should have methods\n     * defined by that interface, but note that it should be just a regular JavaScript object, which you can create\n     * yourself in any way you want (ES6 class, classic function constructor, object literal etc.). In particular do\n     * not attempt to use any RxJS implementation details to create Observers - you don't need them. Remember also\n     * that your object does not have to implement all methods. If you find yourself creating a method that doesn't\n     * do anything, you can simply omit it. Note however, that if `error` method is not provided, all errors will\n     * be left uncaught.\n     *\n     * The second way is to give up on Observer object altogether and simply provide callback functions in place of its methods.\n     * This means you can provide three functions as arguments to `subscribe`, where first function is equivalent\n     * of a `next` method, second of an `error` method and third of a `complete` method. Just as in case of Observer,\n     * if you do not need to listen for something, you can omit a function, preferably by passing `undefined` or `null`,\n     * since `subscribe` recognizes these functions by where they were placed in function call. When it comes\n     * to `error` function, just as before, if not provided, errors emitted by an Observable will be thrown.\n     *\n     * Whatever style of calling `subscribe` you use, in both cases it returns a Subscription object.\n     * This object allows you to call `unsubscribe` on it, which in turn will stop work that an Observable does and will clean\n     * up all resources that an Observable used. Note that cancelling a subscription will not call `complete` callback\n     * provided to `subscribe` function, which is reserved for a regular completion signal that comes from an Observable.\n     *\n     * Remember that callbacks provided to `subscribe` are not guaranteed to be called asynchronously.\n     * It is an Observable itself that decides when these functions will be called. For example {@link of}\n     * by default emits all its values synchronously. Always check documentation for how given Observable\n     * will behave when subscribed and if its default behavior can be modified with a {@link Scheduler}.\n     *\n     * @example <caption>Subscribe with an Observer</caption>\n     * const sumObserver = {\n     *   sum: 0,\n     *   next(value) {\n     *     console.log('Adding: ' + value);\n     *     this.sum = this.sum + value;\n     *   },\n     *   error() { // We actually could just remove this method,\n     *   },        // since we do not really care about errors right now.\n     *   complete() {\n     *     console.log('Sum equals: ' + this.sum);\n     *   }\n     * };\n     *\n     * Rx.Observable.of(1, 2, 3) // Synchronously emits 1, 2, 3 and then completes.\n     * .subscribe(sumObserver);\n     *\n     * // Logs:\n     * // \"Adding: 1\"\n     * // \"Adding: 2\"\n     * // \"Adding: 3\"\n     * // \"Sum equals: 6\"\n     *\n     *\n     * @example <caption>Subscribe with functions</caption>\n     * let sum = 0;\n     *\n     * Rx.Observable.of(1, 2, 3)\n     * .subscribe(\n     *   function(value) {\n     *     console.log('Adding: ' + value);\n     *     sum = sum + value;\n     *   },\n     *   undefined,\n     *   function() {\n     *     console.log('Sum equals: ' + sum);\n     *   }\n     * );\n     *\n     * // Logs:\n     * // \"Adding: 1\"\n     * // \"Adding: 2\"\n     * // \"Adding: 3\"\n     * // \"Sum equals: 6\"\n     *\n     *\n     * @example <caption>Cancel a subscription</caption>\n     * const subscription = Rx.Observable.interval(1000).subscribe(\n     *   num => console.log(num),\n     *   undefined,\n     *   () => console.log('completed!') // Will not be called, even\n     * );                                // when cancelling subscription\n     *\n     *\n     * setTimeout(() => {\n     *   subscription.unsubscribe();\n     *   console.log('unsubscribed!');\n     * }, 2500);\n     *\n     * // Logs:\n     * // 0 after 1s\n     * // 1 after 2s\n     * // \"unsubscribed!\" after 2.5s\n     *\n     *\n     * @param {Observer|Function} observerOrNext (optional) Either an observer with methods to be called,\n     *  or the first of three possible handlers, which is the handler for each value emitted from the subscribed\n     *  Observable.\n     * @param {Function} error (optional) A handler for a terminal event resulting from an error.

If your option values happen to be objects (and you'd like to save the\n * selection in your form as an object), use `ngValue` instead:\n *\n * {\\@example forms/ts/selectControl/select_control_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * In reactive forms, you'll also want to add your form directive (`formControlName` or\n * `formControl`) on the main `<select>` tag. Like in the former example, you have the\n * choice of binding to the  `value` or `ngValue` property on the select's options.\n *\n * {\\@example forms/ts/reactiveSelectControl/reactive_select_control_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * ### Caveat: Option selection\n *\n * Angular uses object identity to select option. It's possible for the identities of items\n * to change while the data does not. This can happen, for example, if the items are produced\n * from an RPC to the server, and that RPC is re-run. Even if the data hasn't changed, the\n * second response will produce objects with different identities.\n *\n * To customize the default option comparison algorithm, `<select>` supports `compareWith` input.\n * `compareWith` takes a **function** which has two arguments: `option1` and `option2`.\n * If `compareWith` is given, Angular selects option by the return value of the function.\n *\n * #### Syntax\n *\n * ```\n * <select [compareWith]=\"compareFn\"  [(ngModel)]=\"selectedCountries\">\n *     <option *ngFor=\"let country of countries\" [ngValue]=\"country\">\n *         {{country.name}}\n *     </option>\n * </select>\n *\n * compareFn(c1: Country, c2: Country): boolean {\n *     return c1 && c2 ? c1.id === c2.id : c1 === c2;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Note: We listen to the 'change' event because 'input' events aren't fired\n * for selects in Firefox and IE:\n * https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1024350\n * https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/issues/4660045/\n *\n * * **npm package**: `\\@angular/forms`\n *\n * \\@stable\n */\nvar SelectControlValueAccessor = (function () {\n    /**\n     * @param {?} _renderer\n     * @param {?} _elementRef\n     */\n    function SelectControlValueAccessor(_renderer, _elementRef) {\n        this._renderer = _renderer;\n        this._elementRef = _elementRef;\n        /**\n         * \\@internal\n         */\n        this._optionMap = new Map();\n        /**\n         * \\@internal\n         */\n        this._idCounter = 0;\n        this.onChange = function (_) { };\n        this.onTouched = function () { };\n        this._compareWith = ɵlooseIdentical;\n    }\n    Object.defineProperty(SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype, \"compareWith\", {\n        /**\n         * @param {?} fn\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        set: function (fn) {\n            if (typeof fn !== 'function') {\n                throw new Error(\"compareWith must be a function, but received \" + JSON.stringify(fn));\n            }\n            this._compareWith = fn;\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    /**\n     * @param {?} value\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype.writeValue = function (value) {\n        this.value = value;\n        var /** @type {?} */ id = this._getOptionId(value);\n        if (id == null) {\n            this._renderer.setProperty(this._elementRef.nativeElement, 'selectedIndex', -1);\n        }\n        var /** @type {?} */ valueString = _buildValueString(id, value);\n        this._renderer.setProperty(this._elementRef.nativeElement, 'value', valueString);\n    };\n    /**\n     * @param {?} fn\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype.registerOnChange = function (fn) {\n        var _this = this;\n        this.onChange = function (valueString) {\n            _this.value = _this._getOptionValue(valueString);\n            fn(_this.value);\n        };\n    };\n    /**\n     * @param {?} fn\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype.registerOnTouched = function (fn) { this.onTouched = fn; };\n    /**\n     * @param {?} isDisabled\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype.setDisabledState = function (isDisabled) {\n        this._renderer.setProperty(this._elementRef.nativeElement, 'disabled', isDisabled);\n    };\n    /**\n     * \\@internal\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype._registerOption = function () { return (this._idCounter++).toString(); };\n    /**\n     * \\@internal\n     * @param {?} value\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype._getOptionId = function (value) {\n        for (var _i = 0, _a = Array.from(this._optionMap.keys()); _i < _a.length; _i++) {\n            var id = _a[_i];\n            if (this._compareWith(this._optionMap.get(id), value))\n                return id;\n        }\n        return null;\n    };\n    /**\n     * \\@internal\n     * @param {?} valueString\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype._getOptionValue = function (valueString) {\n        var /** @type {?} */ id = _extractId(valueString);\n        return this._optionMap.has(id) ?

c1.id === c2.id : c1 === c2;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * \\@stable\n */\nvar SelectMultipleControlValueAccessor = (function () {\n    /**\n     * @param {?} _renderer\n     * @param {?} _elementRef\n     */\n    function SelectMultipleControlValueAccessor(_renderer, _elementRef) {\n        this._renderer = _renderer;\n        this._elementRef = _elementRef;\n        /**\n         * \\@internal\n         */\n        this._optionMap = new Map();\n        /**\n         * \\@internal\n         */\n        this._idCounter = 0;\n        this.onChange = function (_) { };\n        this.onTouched = function () { };\n        this._compareWith = ɵlooseIdentical;\n    }\n    Object.defineProperty(SelectMultipleControlValueAccessor.prototype, \"compareWith\", {\n        /**\n         * @param {?} fn\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        set: function (fn) {\n            if (typeof fn !== 'function') {\n                throw new Error(\"compareWith must be a function, but received \" + JSON.stringify(fn));\n            }\n            this._compareWith = fn;\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    /**\n     * @param {?} value\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectMultipleControlValueAccessor.prototype.writeValue = function (value) {\n        var _this = this;\n        this.value = value;\n        var /** @type {?} */ optionSelectedStateSetter;\n        if (Array.isArray(value)) {\n            // convert values to ids\n            var /** @type {?} */ ids_1 = value.map(function (v) { return _this._getOptionId(v); });\n            optionSelectedStateSetter = function (opt, o) { opt._setSelected(ids_1.indexOf(o.toString()) > -1); };\n        }\n        else {\n            optionSelectedStateSetter = function (opt, o) { opt._setSelected(false); };\n        }\n        this._optionMap.forEach(optionSelectedStateSetter);\n    };\n    /**\n     * @param {?} fn\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectMultipleControlValueAccessor.prototype.registerOnChange = function (fn) {\n        var _this = this;\n        this.onChange = function (_) {\n            var /** @type {?} */ selected = [];\n            if (_.hasOwnProperty('selectedOptions')) {\n                var /** @type {?} */ options = _.selectedOptions;\n                for (var /** @type {?} */ i = 0; i < options.length; i++) {\n                    var /** @type {?} */ opt = options.item(i);\n                    var /** @type {?} */ val = _this._getOptionValue(opt.value);\n                    selected.push(val);\n                }\n            }\n            else {\n                var /** @type {?} */ options = (_.options);\n                for (var /** @type {?} */ i = 0; i < options.length; i++) {\n                    var /** @type {?} */ opt = options.item(i);\n                    if (opt.selected) {\n                        var /** @type {?} */ val = _this._getOptionValue(opt.value);\n                        selected.push(val);\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n            _this.value = selected;\n            fn(selected);\n        };\n    };\n    /**\n     * @param {?} fn\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectMultipleControlValueAccessor.prototype.registerOnTouched = function (fn) { this.onTouched = fn; };\n    /**\n     * @param {?} isDisabled\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectMultipleControlValueAccessor.prototype.setDisabledState = function (isDisabled) {\n        this._renderer.setProperty(this._elementRef.nativeElement, 'disabled', isDisabled);\n    };\n    /**\n     * \\@internal\n     * @param {?} value\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectMultipleControlValueAccessor.prototype._registerOption = function (value) {\n        var /** @type {?} */ id = (this._idCounter++).toString();\n        this._optionMap.set(id, value);\n        return id;\n    };\n    /**\n     * \\@internal\n     * @param {?} value\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectMultipleControlValueAccessor.prototype._getOptionId = function (value) {\n        for (var _i = 0, _a = Array.from(this._optionMap.keys()); _i < _a.length; _i++) {\n            var id = _a[_i];\n            if (this._compareWith(/** @type {?} */ ((this._optionMap.get(id)))._value, value))\n                return id;\n        }\n        return null;\n    };\n    /**\n     * \\@internal\n     * @param {?} valueString\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectMultipleControlValueAccessor.prototype._getOptionValue = function (valueString) {\n        var /** @type {?} */ id = _extractId$1(valueString);\n        return this._optionMap.has(id) ?

For example, if one of the controls in a group is invalid, the entire\n * group becomes invalid.\n *\n * `FormGroup` is one of the three fundamental building blocks used to define forms in Angular,\n * along with {\\@link FormControl} and {\\@link FormArray}.\n *\n * \\@howToUse\n *\n * When instantiating a {\\@link FormGroup}, pass in a collection of child controls as the first\n * argument.

You don't need to add a special selector.\n *\n * You can export the directive into a local template variable using `ngForm` as the key\n * (ex: `#myForm=\"ngForm\"`). This is optional, but useful.  Many properties from the underlying\n * {\\@link FormGroup} instance are duplicated on the directive itself, so a reference to it\n * will give you access to the aggregate value and validity status of the form, as well as\n * user interaction properties like `dirty` and `touched`.\n *\n * To register child controls with the form, you'll want to use {\\@link NgModel} with a\n * `name` attribute.  You can also use {\\@link NgModelGroup} if you'd like to create\n * sub-groups within the form.\n *\n * You can listen to the directive's `ngSubmit` event to be notified when the user has\n * triggered a form submission. The `ngSubmit` event will be emitted with the original form\n * submission event.\n *\n * In template driven forms, all `<form>` tags are automatically tagged as `NgForm`.\n * If you want to import the `FormsModule` but skip its usage in some forms,\n * for example, to use native HTML5 validation, you can add `ngNoForm` and the `<form>`\n * tags won't create an `NgForm` directive. In reactive forms, using `ngNoForm` is\n * unnecessary because the `<form>` tags are inert. In that case, you would\n * refrain from using the `formGroup` directive.\n *\n * {\\@example forms/ts/simpleForm/simple_form_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * * **npm package**: `\\@angular/forms`\n *\n * * **NgModule**: `FormsModule`\n *\n *  \\@stable\n */\nvar NgForm = (function (_super) {\n    tslib_1.__extends(NgForm, _super);\n    /**\n     * @param {?} validators\n     * @param {?} asyncValidators\n     */\n    function NgForm(validators, asyncValidators) {\n        var _this = _super.call(this) || this;\n        _this._submitted = false;\n        _this.ngSubmit = new EventEmitter();\n        _this.form =\n            new FormGroup({}, composeValidators(validators), composeAsyncValidators(asyncValidators));\n        return _this;\n    }\n    Object.defineProperty(NgForm.prototype, \"submitted\", {\n        /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        get: function () { return this._submitted;

All you need is the\n * `ngModel` selector to activate it.\n *\n * It accepts a domain model as an optional {\\@link Input}. If you have a one-way binding\n * to `ngModel` with `[]` syntax, changing the value of the domain model in the component\n * class will set the value in the view. If you have a two-way binding with `[()]` syntax\n * (also known as 'banana-box syntax'), the value in the UI will always be synced back to\n * the domain model in your class as well.\n *\n * If you wish to inspect the properties of the associated {\\@link FormControl} (like\n * validity state), you can also export the directive into a local template variable using\n * `ngModel` as the key (ex: `#myVar=\"ngModel\"`). You can then access the control using the\n * directive's `control` property, but most properties you'll need (like `valid` and `dirty`)\n * will fall through to the control anyway, so you can access them directly. You can see a\n * full list of properties directly available in {\\@link AbstractControlDirective}.\n *\n * The following is an example of a simple standalone control using `ngModel`:\n *\n * {\\@example forms/ts/simpleNgModel/simple_ng_model_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * When using the `ngModel` within `<form>` tags, you'll also need to supply a `name` attribute\n * so that the control can be registered with the parent form under that name.\n *\n * It's worth noting that in the context of a parent form, you often can skip one-way or\n * two-way binding because the parent form will sync the value for you. You can access\n * its properties by exporting it into a local template variable using `ngForm` (ex:\n * `#f=\"ngForm\"`). Then you can pass it where it needs to go on submit.\n *\n * If you do need to populate initial values into your form, using a one-way binding for\n * `ngModel` tends to be sufficient as long as you use the exported form's value rather\n * than the domain model's value on submit.\n *\n * Take a look at an example of using `ngModel` within a form:\n *\n * {\\@example forms/ts/simpleForm/simple_form_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * To see `ngModel` examples with different form control types, see:\n *\n * * Radio buttons: {\\@link RadioControlValueAccessor}\n * * Selects: {\\@link SelectControlValueAccessor}\n *\n * **npm package**: `\\@angular/forms`\n *\n * **NgModule**: `FormsModule`\n *\n *  \\@stable\n */\nvar NgModel = (function (_super) {\n    tslib_1.__extends(NgModel, _super);\n    /**\n     * @param {?} parent\n     * @param {?} validators\n     * @param {?} asyncValidators\n     * @param {?} valueAccessors\n     */\n    function NgModel(parent, validators, asyncValidators, valueAccessors) {\n        var _this = _super.call(this) || this;\n        /**\n         * \\@internal\n         */\n        _this._control = new FormControl();\n        /**\n         * \\@internal\n         */\n        _this._registered = false;\n        _this.update = new EventEmitter();\n        _this._parent = parent;\n        _this._rawValidators = validators || [];\n        _this._rawAsyncValidators = asyncValidators || [];\n        _this.valueAccessor = selectValueAccessor(_this, valueAccessors);\n        return _this;\n    }\n    /**\n     * @param {?} changes\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    NgModel.prototype.ngOnChanges = function (changes) {\n        this._checkForErrors();\n        if (!this._registered)\n            this._setUpControl();\n        if ('isDisabled' in changes) {\n            this._updateDisabled(changes);\n        }\n        if (isPropertyUpdated(changes, this.viewModel)) {\n            this._updateValue(this.model);\n            this.viewModel = this.model;\n        }\n    };\n    /**\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    NgModel.prototype.ngOnDestroy = function () { this.formDirective && this.formDirective.removeControl(this); };\n    Object.defineProperty(NgModel.prototype, \"control\", {\n        /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        get: function () { return this._control; },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    Object.defineProperty(NgModel.prototype, \"path\", {\n        /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        get: function () {\n            return this._parent ?

That means `forkJoin` will\n     * not emit more than once and it will complete after that. If you need to emit combined values not only\n     * at the end of lifecycle of passed Observables, but also throughout it, try out {@link combineLatest}\n     * or {@link zip} instead.\n     *\n     * In order for resulting array to have the same length as the number of input Observables, whenever any of\n     * that Observables completes without emitting any value, `forkJoin` will complete at that moment as well\n     * and it will not emit anything either, even if it already has some last values from other Observables.\n     * Conversely, if there is an Observable that never completes, `forkJoin` will never complete as well,\n     * unless at any point some other Observable completes without emitting value, which brings us back to\n     * the previous case. Overall, in order for `forkJoin` to emit a value, all Observables passed as arguments\n     * have to emit something at least once and complete.\n     *\n     * If any input Observable errors at some point, `forkJoin` will error as well and all other Observables\n     * will be immediately unsubscribed.\n     *\n     * Optionally `forkJoin` accepts project function, that will be called with values which normally\n     * would land in emitted array.
